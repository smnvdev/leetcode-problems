Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is palindrome integer.

An integer is a **palindrome** when it reads the same backward as forward.
- For example, `121` is a palindrome while `123` is not.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```
**Example 3:**
```
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

Constraints:
 - `-2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1`
